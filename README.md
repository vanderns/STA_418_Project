# STA 418 Project: Uber Data Presentation through Voronoi Diagrams
**Project Overview**\
Our project will be on Uber data analysis, representing monthly booking and location based booking through Voronoi diagrams. A Voronoi diagram is a model that takes select points, and then draws boundaries around those points. The boundaries state which point you are closest to when in that boundary. Our goal is to look at a specific city and the points at which Ubers are called from. We will then create a Voronoi diagram based on that information, see how the diagram changes over time, and perform a sensitivity analysis.\

**Objectives**\
Our project will meet course objectives because we will work with data from Uber and create models using this data. We will use `r` to create our program and analysis of Uber data.
