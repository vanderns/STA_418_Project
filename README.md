# STA 418 Project: Uber Data Presentation through Voronoi Diagrams
## By Nathan Vandermeer and Manikumar Danaveni
**Project Overview**\
Our project will be on Uber data analysis, representing monthly booking and location based booking through Voronoi diagrams. A Voronoi diagram is a model that takes select points, and then draws boundaries around those points. The boundaries state which point you are closest to when in that boundary. Our goal is to look at a New York City and the points at which Ubers are called from. We will then create a Voronoi diagram based on that information, see how the diagram changes over time, and perform a sensitivity analysis. We will also analyze the data of times at which an Uber was called.\

Here we have an example Voronoi Diagram created. Each of the points is the location that an Uber was called for. The regions surrounding each point then represent which client a certain driver is closest to.\
**Objectives**\
Our project works with a ton of data. We format the data in many ways to create our desired product. We worked entirely in `R`, and made many functions and programs to create our diagrams. Our presentation lays out our methodology and results. The code for our project can be found in `Project_Overview.Rmd`.
